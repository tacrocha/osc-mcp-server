# Quick Start Guide - OSC MCP Server for Claude Desktop

## Installation Steps

### 1. Find Your Mixer IP Address

On your mixer:
1. Press the **SETUP** button
2. Navigate to **Network** settings
3. Note the IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.70`)

### 2. Configure Claude Desktop

**macOS**: Open or create the file at:
```
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

**Windows**: Open or create the file at:
```
%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

**Linux**: Open or create the file at:
```
~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

### 3. Add the OSC Server Configuration

Copy the contents from `claude_desktop_config.json` in this repository, or add this to your config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "osc": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/osc-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "OSC_HOST": "192.168.1.70",
        "OSC_PORT": "10024"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: 
- Replace `/path/to/osc-mcp/dist/index.js` with the actual path to your installation
- Replace `192.168.1.70` with your mixer's actual IP address
- The default OSC port for X-Air is `10024`

### 4. Restart Claude Desktop

Completely quit and restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.

### 5. Verify Installation

In Claude Desktop, start a new conversation and try:

```

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection timeout" or "No response from mixer"

1. **Check network connectivity**:
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.70
   ```
   (Replace with your mixer's IP)

2. **Verify the mixer is on** and connected to the same network

3. **Check firewall settings** - ensure UDP port 10024 is not blocked

### "Tools not appearing in Claude"

1. **Verify the config file path** is correct for your OS
2. **Check JSON syntax** - use a JSON validator if needed
3. **Restart Claude Desktop** completely (quit and reopen)
4. **Check Claude Desktop logs**:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\`

### "Cannot find module" errors

1. Make sure you've run `npm install` and `npm run build`
2. Verify the path in the config file points to the correct location
3. Check that Node.js is installed: `node --version`

## Network Setup Tips

### Same Network
Your computer and mixer must be on the same network. You can:
- Connect both to the same WiFi network
- Connect via Ethernet to the same switch/router
- Use a direct Ethernet connection (may require static IP configuration)

### Static IP (Recommended)
For reliability, set a static IP on your mixer:
1. Press **SETUP** on the mixer
2. Go to **Network**
3. Set a static IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.70`)
4. Set subnet mask (usually `255.255.255.0`)
5. Set gateway to your router's IP
