# Testing Guide

This guide explains how to test the OSC MCP server using an external emulator (e.g., X32-Edit).

## Overview

Since we are using an external application to emulate the X32 mixer, you will need to:

1.  **Install and Run the Emulator**: Download and install the X32-Edit application (or similar emulator) from the Behringer website.
2.  **Configure the Emulator**:
    *   Ensure the emulator is running and listening for OSC commands.
    *   Note the IP address and Port the emulator is using (usually UDP port 10023).
3.  **Configure the MCP Server**:
    *   Update your `claude_desktop_config.json` to point to the emulator's IP and Port.

## Configuration

Edit your Claude Desktop config file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add or update the configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "osc": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/osc-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "OSC_HOST": "127.0.0.1", // Or the IP of your emulator
        "OSC_PORT": "10023"      // The port your emulator is listening on
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Running Tests

You can run the connection test script to verify connectivity to the emulator:

```bash
npm test
```

This will attempt to connect to the X32 mixer (or emulator) at the configured address and perform basic operations.

## Manual Testing

Once connected, you can use Claude Desktop to control the emulator. Try commands like:

*   "Set channel 1 fader to 75%"
*   "Mute channel 3"
*   "Pan channel 2 to the left"

Verify the changes are reflected in the emulator's interface.
